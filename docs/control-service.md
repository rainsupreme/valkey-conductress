# Fleet control service

The control service is a durable mailbox and status registry for independent Conductress runners. It runs only on the data host. It does not execute benchmarks and it never opens connections to benchmark hosts.

Runner polling and inbox-to-local-queue import are handled elsewhere; deploying this service alone changes no runner.

## Safety invariants

- The service listens on `127.0.0.1` only; an existing TLS reverse proxy is the network entrance.
- Every API route requires a bearer token.
- Runner identity comes from its token, not a request body.
- A claim lease covers transfer into the runner's local queue only.
- Lease expiry can requeue `claimed` work, but never `accepted` work.
- Accepted tasks are never reassigned automatically.
- A runner may own only one accepted task at a time; prefetch/pipelining is intentionally deferred.
- Authentication attempts and API requests are rate-limited by the reverse proxy example.
- Control-plane loss cannot interrupt a benchmark because no execution lease exists.
- SQLite and the append-only audit log survive service restart.

## Install

Use a dedicated source checkout and virtual environment on the data host:

```bash
python3 -m venv /opt/conductress-control/.venv
/opt/conductress-control/.venv/bin/pip install '/opt/conductress-control[control]'
```

The `control` extra is intentionally absent from runner installations. It contains exact-pinned `aiohttp` and `jsonschema` dependencies.

## Private configuration

Create:

```text
/etc/conductress-control/fleet.json
/etc/conductress-control/tokens.json
/var/lib/conductress-control/
/var/log/conductress-control/
```

Suggested ownership and modes:

```text
/etc/conductress-control/fleet.json      root:conductress 0640
/etc/conductress-control/tokens.json     root:conductress 0640
/var/lib/conductress-control             conductress:conductress 0750
/var/log/conductress-control             conductress:conductress 0750
```

Start from `deploy/control-service/fleet.json.example` and `tokens.json.example`. The example hashes are inert placeholders and must be replaced.

Generate a random token, keep the plaintext only at its client, and hash it without exposing it in the process list:

```bash
conductress-control hash-token
```

Store only the printed SHA-256 digest. Give each runner a separate token so it can be revoked independently.

## Run locally

```bash
CONTROL_DB_PATH=/var/lib/conductress-control/control.db \
FLEET_MANIFEST_PATH=/etc/conductress-control/fleet.json \
TOKENS_PATH=/etc/conductress-control/tokens.json \
AUDIT_JSONL_PATH=/var/log/conductress-control/audit.jsonl \
conductress-control serve --port 8390
```

The host is deliberately not configurable: the process always binds `127.0.0.1`. Use `deploy/control-service/conductress-control.service` and the reverse-proxy snippet for persistent deployment.

The production data host uses local XFS storage, which supports SQLite WAL mode. Do not place `control.db` on NFS.

## API

All routes are under `/api/v1/` and all JSON responses include `schema_version: 1`.

Public read-only route:

```text
GET    /api/v1/public/dashboard
```

This route is intentionally unauthenticated for the public status page. It returns only nonterminal mailbox task summaries: runner ID, task ID, state, class, priority, submitted time, type, source, specifier, note, and expected duration. Each runner always includes the authoritative `total_count`, plus `returned_count`, `truncated`, and `expected_duration_complete`; task details remain capped at 50 per runner. It never returns submitter identity, full envelopes, claim tokens, leases, outcomes, credentials, or mutation controls. Disabled runners are omitted. Responses allow cross-origin `GET`/`OPTIONS` reads and permit five seconds of shared caching. The reverse proxy MUST rate-limit this route; the provided `/api/v1/` rate limit applies to it.

Operator routes:

```text
GET    /api/v1/health
POST   /api/v1/tasks
GET    /api/v1/tasks?runner_id=&state=&limit=&offset=
GET    /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}
DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}
GET    /api/v1/fleet
GET    /api/v1/fleet/{runner_id}
```

Runner routes:

```text
PUT  /api/v1/runners/{runner_id}/status
POST /api/v1/runners/{runner_id}/claim
POST /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/accept
POST /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/complete
POST /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}/fail
```

Submit a task envelope:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CONDUCTRESS_OPERATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Idempotency-Key: example-request-1' \
  --data @task-envelope.json \
  https://data.conductress.rainsupreme.net/api/v1/tasks
```

Errors use stable codes:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "error": "only queued tasks can be cancelled",
  "code": "TASK_NOT_CANCELLABLE"
}
```

## Task lifecycle

```text
queued -> claimed -> accepted -> completed
                    \-> accepted -> failed
claimed --lease expires before accept--> queued
queued -> cancelled
pending-approval -> queued        (approved)
pending-approval -> cancelled     (rejected)
queued | pending-approval -> cancelled          (caller cancels an unclaimed task)
claimed | accepted -> cancel-requested          (caller cancels an in-flight task)
```

`POST .../claim` is idempotent for a runner while its transfer lease is active: repeated requests return the same task and claim token. The runner persists the task locally, then sends the token to `POST .../accept`. No heartbeat or lease renewal occurs after acceptance.

Task submission supports an `Idempotency-Key` header. Replaying the same key and payload returns the existing task; changing the payload produces `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`.

## Identity, provenance, and approval

A directory of users and agents (`users.toml`, path from `USERS_PATH`) maps a bearer-token login to a GitHub account, a role (`owner`, `collaborator`, `approver`), a daily runner-minute quota, and allowed sources. An agent draws on its human sponsor's account and quota. Tokens carry a `user` role and a `login`; operator and runner tokens are unchanged.

When provenance verification is enabled (`PROVENANCE_VERIFICATION=true`, with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` for a higher rate limit), a submission's `provenance.sha` is accepted only if it is reachable from an allowlisted repository (the two project repositories plus the submitter's own fork) or is the head of an open pull request against the upstream project; the verified pull-request identity is stored on the envelope. An owner may bypass with `?bypass_provenance=true`. A rejected sha returns `PROVENANCE_REJECTED`.

A submission from a login that is not in the directory, or from a user over its daily quota, is held in `pending-approval` rather than queued. An approver lists held tasks and approves or rejects them by task ID or batch ID.

### Approval, batch, and cancel routes

```text
GET  /api/v1/tasks/mine            (a user's own tasks)
GET  /api/v1/tasks/pending         (approver: tasks awaiting approval)
POST /api/v1/tasks/{selector}/approve   (approver: queue a held task or batch)
POST /api/v1/tasks/{selector}/reject    (approver: reject a held task or batch)
GET  /api/v1/batches/{batch_id}    (tasks sharing a batch id)
DELETE /api/v1/tasks/{selector}    (cancel a task or whole batch)
```

`selector` is a task ID or a batch ID. Cancelling an unclaimed task (`queued` or `pending-approval`) cancels it outright; cancelling an in-flight task (`claimed` or `accepted`) marks it `cancel-requested`, and the runner stops at its next rep/cell boundary. A non-owner may cancel only their own tasks; an owner or operator may cancel anyone's. The `conductress queue cancel|mine|pending|approve|reject` commands and `queue add* --batch` are thin clients over these routes.

### Approval notification hook

When `NOTIFICATION_URL` is set, the control plane POSTs a small JSON notice to that URL each time a submission lands in `pending-approval`. Delivery is best effort and never blocks submission. The payload is:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "event": "task.pending_approval",
  "task_id": "2026.09.30_20.00.00.000000",
  "batch_id": "batch-0123456789abcdef",
  "runner_id": "armbench",
  "submitter_login": "ghost",
  "submitted_by": "ghost",
  "reason": "submitter is not a known user"
}
```

## Results on the data host

At completion a runner pushes the full result record, not a truncated summary. The control plane stores it in the task's SQLite row (authoritative). When configured it also mirrors each completed task to an append-only results JSONL (`RESULTS_JSONL_PATH`) and publishes a static per-task JSON under the published tasks directory (`PUBLISHED_TASKS_DIR/tasks/<task_id>.json`), written atomically. The static files carry no auth (results are public) so the dashboard and agents can fetch them directly, and `GET /api/v1/tasks/{task_id}` and `GET /api/v1/batches/{batch_id}` return the same records over the API.

The record keeps every scalar and aggregate, the peak-memory scalars, and the categorized jemalloc `breakdown`. It drops only the unbounded stack arrays: the jemalloc per-frame `raw_stacks` and the collapsed CPU flamegraph stacks (`cpu_stacks_main`, `cpu_stacks_io`). The full stacks remain on the runner and in the runner-published artifacts.

## Persistence and backup

SQLite uses WAL mode, foreign keys, explicit `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` claim transactions, and a five-second busy timeout. Back up with SQLite's online backup command rather than copying only the main file while WAL files are active:

```bash
sqlite3 /var/lib/conductress-control/control.db ".backup '/var/lib/conductress-control/control.backup.db'"
```

`audit_log` in SQLite is authoritative. `/var/log/conductress-control/audit.jsonl` is a best-effort append-only mirror for external inspection.

## Out of scope for this service

This service does not include:

- fleet-aware local CLI commands;

- status publication between jobs;
- daily canary scheduling;
- deployment to the data host;
- multiple same-platform scheduling.
