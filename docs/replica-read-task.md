# Replica-read task

`conductress queue add-replica-read` measures read throughput served by a
**replica** while its primary ingests writes at a fixed rate over a real
replication link. Score = mean reader throughput (GET/s at the first replica).

Why a replica: on a replica the only writer is the replication stream, executed
on the main thread, so no client connection ever interleaves writes with reads.
That makes it the cleanest topology for measuring any change to how a server
serves reads while writes are arriving (I/O-thread read offload, read-path
locking, memory reclamation under replication load, and so on). Most production
read scaling is done by adding replicas, so it is also the node population such
a change would reach first.

## Topology

All instances run on one benchmark host over loopback, each with its own
port, working directory (`--dir`, so full-sync RDB files do not collide),
logfile and CPU allocation from the topology-aware allocator.

| instance | port          | io-threads             | generator                          |
|----------|---------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| primary  | `--base-port` | `--primary-io-threads` | writer: cachecannon SET, `rate_limit` = `--write-rate` |
| replica  | base + 1      | `--io-threads`         | reader: cachecannon GET, closed loop, `--connections`/`--threads`/`--pipelining` |
| replica  | base + 2 ...  | `--io-threads`         | none (extra `--replicas` add fan-out load only) |

`--replicas` is an instance count on the runner host, not a host count: the
task needs exactly one `servers.json` entry, unlike replication-group tasks
where each replica is a separate configured host.

Server arguments: `--server-args` applies to every instance; `--primary-args`
and `--replica-args` are appended after it for their role, so a role-specific
flag overrides a shared one (valkey applies later command-line config over
earlier). `--replica-args` is the natural A/B lever for a replica-side config
change on a single build.

## Phases per repetition

1. Kill stray servers, start the topology, `REPLICAOF`, wait for link up.
2. Preload: cachecannon prefill of `--keyspace` keys at the primary, then wait
   until every replica's offset equals the primary's and both key counts match.
3. Measure: start the fixed-rate writer at the primary, one second later the
   reader at the first replica (`--warmup` + `--duration`). `INFO replication
   stats` is sampled from every instance every `--sample-interval` seconds
   with a single remote shell per sample, so primary/replica offset skew is a
   few milliseconds. `--info-fields` adds arbitrary INFO fields to the sample
   (for example counters a build under test exposes); absent fields are
   omitted, not errors. The same shell also reads the host's per-core
   `/proc/stat` and every instance's per-thread CPU ticks; the two local
   cachecannon processes' thread ticks are read from `/proc` on the runner in
   the same tick.
4. Guards (fail loudly): reader 0% errors and >= 99% hit rate; writer 0%
   errors and achieved rate >= 90% of `--write-rate`. An under-delivering
   writer would silently turn the run into a lower-write-rate run.
5. Bottleneck verdict (recorded, logged at WARNING when not `server`; the run
   does not fail, its data is still diagnostic). Computed over the samples
   after `--warmup`:

   | Verdict | Rule | Score is |
   |---|---|---|
   | `host` | a core no party was allocated is > 5% busy | invalid: interference |
   | `generator` | a cachecannon reader thread >= 0.95 of a core | invalid: reader-bound |
   | `ambiguous` | reader thread >= 0.85 but < 0.95 | untrusted |
   | `server` | none of the above | the server's number |
   | `unknown` | fewer than 2 samples in the window | untrusted |

   `server` means "nothing else is implicated", **not** "the server was proven
   saturated". Valkey's I/O threads busy-wait for work and the main thread
   polls without sleeping while I/O jobs are in flight, so server CPU time
   reads close to 100% far below the throughput ceiling. On a 16-core x86
   development host with a stock build and `--io-threads 2`, the I/O thread
   read 1.00 of a core at one fifth of the throughput it later sustained, and
   the main thread read 0.81 at one half. Server CPU is therefore stored but
   never thresholded. The main thread's `loop_duty` (`eventloop_duration_sum`
   per wall second, which excludes the poll) is attached as evidence; on the
   same host it rose 0.09 / 0.23 / 0.58 / 0.81 at 5% / 20% / 50% / 100% of the
   ceiling. cachecannon's worker threads block in their poller, so their CPU
   time does track load and is safe to threshold. Confirming a ceiling needs a
   load step (the same run at a higher connection count showing no gain),
   which is a separate control run, not yet built. Foreign-core detection needs
   to know where the generators run; `--client-cpus` supplies that as well as
   the allocator does, so the check runs either way.

## Result row

`method = "replica-read"`, `score` = mean reader rps over reps, `cv`/`reps`
as for other tasks. `data` carries: the topology spec, per-port server CPUs,
writer target and achieved rate, replication lag (primary minus replica
offset, bytes: max/mean, per-rep p99), per-rep reader/writer latency, the
per-instance INFO series (offsets, ops/sec, eventloop counters, `--info-fields`),
both generated TOMLs, and `bottleneck`: the row-level verdict (`server` only
if every rep was), the worst rep's reason, mean replica `loop_duty`, and the
hottest reader thread. Each rep's `bottleneck` holds the full evidence:
per-role thread CPU (main, io-threads, others, hottest), replica and primary
event-loop duty, reader/writer thread utilisation, and per-core softirq share
on the replica's and reader's cores. Raw per-core and per-thread counters are
not stored (they would add about 1 MB per rep on a 96-core host).

Lag resolution is bounded by sample skew times replication bytes per second;
lags below that are noise and are clamped at zero.

## A/B recipe

Two tasks that differ only in `--specifier` (two builds) or `--replica-args`
(one build, two configurations):

```bash
conductress queue add-replica-read --source valkey --specifier <baseline-sha> \
  --io-threads 8 --write-rate 50000 --runner <runner> --note "replica-read baseline w50k io8"
conductress queue add-replica-read --source <fork> --specifier <candidate-sha> \
  --io-threads 8 --write-rate 50000 --runner <runner> --note "replica-read candidate w50k io8"
```

Both arms of a comparison must run on the same runner. Sweeping `--write-rate`
(the replication-stream rate) and `--io-threads` (the replica's parallelism)
covers the two axes a read-path change is most likely to depend on. Match
rows by note and specifier in `results/output.jsonl`.

## Not yet

- Cluster mode: `TopologySpec` can describe `cluster_enabled` per instance
  (bus port = port + 10000) but the bootstrap (ADDSLOTS / MEET / REPLICATE) is
  not implemented; `TopologyGroup.start` refuses such a spec. In cluster mode
  the reader would also need `READONLY` on each connection.
- Event phases (full sync at time t, failover, slot migration) are the natural
  next step on the same runner: a phase list on the task plus per-instance
  actions, with INFO sampled across the event.
- Sweep coordinator integration: this is a manual-queue task type only.
- Load-step control run: repeat the reader at 2x connections (and at half the
  reader threads) and compare. No gain at 2x with the reader still cool is the
  actual proof of a server ceiling, and a proportional drop at half threads
  would expose a reader-bound run that CPU sampling missed. Memory-bandwidth
  and last-level-cache contention between co-located instances are only
  visible this way.
- Loopback is not a network. Replication lag, full-sync duration and failover
  timing measured on one host are lower bounds for what a real link would
  show; read throughput under a given replication rate is the question this
  task answers.
