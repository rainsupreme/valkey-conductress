# Provisioning: how a server binary for a given revision comes to exist.
#   "built-from-git"   clone ``source``, check out the revision, run make with
#                      ``make_args`` (Valkey, Redis).
#   "prebuilt-release" download the official release asset for the host
#                      architecture; no source is ever checked out.  Reserved
#                      for engines whose source licence the project does not
#                      accept on its runners; not implemented yet.
#
# Scope: which revisions the sweep measures.
#   "history"          every merge commit since the floor: release landmarks,
#                      bisection of significant deltas, backfill of gaps, and
#                      each new tip (Valkey).
#   "release-and-tip"  the latest release only, plus the current tip sampled at
#                      most once per ``tip_interval_hours``.  No bisection, no
