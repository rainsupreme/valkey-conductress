"""One-time export of an archived epoch's dashboard files.

An archived epoch (``config.SWEEP_ARCHIVED_EPOCHS``, currently ``v1``) is never
built or loaded by the runner service: its state files are gigabytes each and
their history never changes again, so paying that load cost at every restart is
pure waste.  Its already-exported dashboard files normally persist in the
publish export dir (``config.PUBLISH_EXPORT_DIR``) across restarts and are
re-synced as-is, so archiving loses no history.

The one case that does lose history is a runner whose export dir was wiped (an
old-code restart, a fresh host): with no v1 coordinator ever loading state,
nothing regenerates those files.  This module is the one-time repair.  It loads
the archived epoch's state files ONCE, exports its series, per-request metric,
CPU-stack and notable files plus its manifest into the export dir, and returns.
It is invoked only by ``conductress sweep export-archived`` -- never from the
service start path -- so the load cost is paid deliberately, once, by hand.

Only ``v1`` is supported: it is the only archived epoch, and its coordinators
(the unqualified throughput series, the retired latency series, the memory
series, and each comparison engine's v1 mirror) are exactly the ones the runner
used to build before archival.
