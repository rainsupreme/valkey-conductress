"""Retired epoch-1 latency series: keeps its history published, never schedules.

This series measured GET p99 at a flat request rate with memtier_benchmark.
The epoch-3 latency series replaced it (see ``config.SWEEP_V1_RETIRED_SERIES``),
so the task type that produced its points no longer exists.  The coordinator
remains because the publisher exports every series through its coordinator:
without it the dashboard would lose the recorded history.  The base class
never asks a retired series for a task, so the scheduling hooks below are
unreachable and say so.
